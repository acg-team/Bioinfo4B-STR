# We run the GangSTR STR genotyping tool on our alignment
# GangSTR needs the reference genome and a tab-separated file indicating where STR loci are located
# in the reference genome. Run `GangSTR --help` in your terminal to see how to run GangSTR. 
# Then, fill in the command below and run this script (or run GangSTR directly in your terminal)
